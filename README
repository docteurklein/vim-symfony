Symfony2 plugin for ViM
=======================

This plugin handles:
    * symfony routing autocompletion
    * symfony DIC autocompletion
    * php stack trace navigation using quickfix list

=========================

To handle routing or DIC autocompletion, you must have a ``app/console`` script that returns valid output concerning dic and routing. 
In other terms, check that ``app/console container:debug`` and ``app/console router:debug`` are working well.

Then you can use <C-x><C-u> (user completion feature) to see all routes and DIC services with some extra informations in the ViM's menu popup.

=========================

To handle stack trace navigation with Symfony2, you can use this exception handler class:

    https://github.com/docteurklein/vim-symfony/blob/master/VimExceptionHandler.php

Don't forget to require it in your autoload system.

Then you'll have to register the exception listener, for example (in your config_dev.yml):

    services:
        vim.stack_trace:
            class: VimExceptionHandler
            tags:
                -  { name: 'kernel.event_listener', event: 'kernel.exception', method: 'onKernelException' }

To use it in another system, just use the same class by typing:

    // require 'VimExceptionHandler.php'
    VimExceptionHandler::register();
